The applicant has primarily worked on Mac in previous roles and is highly familiar with the macOS development environment. Continuing on Windows requires additional adaptation effort and may reduce productivity. Currently, our team has only one Mac device, and all macOS-related performance validation, debugging, and issue reproduction rely on a single colleague, which creates a bottleneck. Having an additional Mac would help share the workload, improve overall team efficiency, and ensure our applications are well validated on both Windows and macOS platforms. Moreover, many teams in other regions (e.g., the UK) have already migrated to Mac, and equipping our team with another Mac will keep us aligned and reduce collaboration costs.

Front-end toolchains (Node.js, Docker, mobile simulators, etc.) generally run more smoothly on macOS, which significantly reduces environment-related issues and improves development and debugging efficiency.
